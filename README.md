## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>
This repo is a list of CDK example code. Currently all code is in TypeScript only.
These examples each provide a demonstration of a common service implementation, or 
infrastructure pattern that could be useful in your use of the CDK for building your own infrastructure.

This is considered an intermediate learning resource and should typically be referenced after reading the 
Developer Guide or CDK Workshop (please see [Learning Resources](#Learning) for more information on these resources).

## Learning Resources <a name="Learning"></a>
While this is an excellent learning resource for the CDK, there are other resources that can be referenced
